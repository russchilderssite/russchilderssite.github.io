## If You Want Any More, You've Got to Sing It Yourself!

"Imagine yourself in the past - say, one hundred years ago - on the porch of a
mountainside cabin after the day's work is complete. This twilight time of day
is typically when songsters and storytellers weave their magic. My imaginary
setting is informal. The children gather around as songs and stories familiar
to my ancestors are revisited. There is no TV or radio or even electricity to
run either one. In this picture from the past, books are not plentiful, so
history, both truth and fiction, is passed from generation to generation through
the vehicle of songs and stories. Singing and storytelling are integral to the
mountain life my forebears experienced, so I incorporate many songs and stories
into my programs. Besides demonstrating the self-sufficiency and independent
character of the Appalachian resident, the program illustrates several
Appalachian instruments, e.g., banjo, fiddle, guitar, and lap dulcimer. I show
that sound is produced from vibrations of my strings and how the instruments
function. Because process is important to children, I am able to use props such
as a groundhog skin on a stretcher frame to illustrate how my ancestors
manufactured everyday items from the resources around them. Moving by story and
song through my family history, we all learn about making do with what we have
and gain some valuable lessons in self-sufficiency."

Using story and song, the artist shares memories of his family's Eastern
Kentucky farm life. Children learn the trials and joys of Appalachian living
over the past two hundred years. Focus is on the positive contributions of
Appalachian culture as transferred through the artist's traditional music and
storytelling. Appalachian survival depends on learning to use what is at hand
and instills creativity and resourcefulness in its citizenry, along with a firm
emphasis on family values. Children learn to celebrate their own creativity
through singing and rhythm exercises with the performer. Featured instruments
are the banjo, fiddle, lap dulcimer, guitar, and various homemade/recycled
instruments. Storytelling includes traditional Jack tales, tall tales, and
personal anecdotes.
