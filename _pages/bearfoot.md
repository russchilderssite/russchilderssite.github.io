Russ and [Barb Childers](barb.html) have been singing and playing music together
as BEAR FOOT since 1983, when they appeared together in an off-Broadway
production called "Close Harmonies" celebrating Appalachian poetry, music, and
dance. They arrived at the musical present by different paths -- Russ through
years of playing music with various groups such as Company Comin' and the
Cincinnati Dancing Pigs -- and Barb through dance. She was a founding member of
an Appalachian clogdance trio called The Dancin' Fools and editor of a clogdance
newsletter called The Footnoter. Together they have conducted children's
workshops in games, dance, and song; have participated in school programs on
Appalachian music and dance; have taken part in storytelling programs, and have
taught clogdancing workshops. Russ's ancestors settled in the Appalachian
mountains in the early 1800s, while Barb's family stayed in New England and
later the Ohio Valley. However, one of her Scots relatives strayed into eastern
Kentucky, and that's where she figures the love of mountain music comes from!
Both of the Childers spent their childhoods listening to their parents tell
stories... and singing... and dancing. And now it's time to pass it on... BEAR
FOOT asks you to join them as they whisk you away to another time and another
place. With Russ on banjo or fiddle and Barb on guitar, washboard, spoons,
paperbags, and even feet, share the music, stories, games, songs, and dances of
the Appalachian Mountains as it was in the time before television. Imagine...!
