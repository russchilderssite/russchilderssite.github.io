* [John Brown's Dream](assets/music/John_Brown.mp3) - Another historic tune
played by Russ Childers, Gayle Brown, and Susan Eison at the 2002 Breakin' Up
Winter Festival in Lebanon TN. and recorded on vinatage cylinder recording
equipment by [Martin Fisher](mailto:nipper@nc5.infi.net). Russ, banjo; Gayle,
guitar; and Susan, bass.

* [Run Mountain](assets/music/Run_Mountain.mp3) - Run Mountain - Key of G.
Warren, lead vocal; Judy, Barb, Russ, harmonies. Don't blame us. J. E. Mainer
and his Mountaineers made us do it, but Tim Wilson's version still inspires
those of us who remember Company Comin's premier fiddler. When in doubt, sing
louder.
