When Barb Childers appears in an Appalachian storytelling musical duo called
[Bear Foot](bearfoot.html), she is the Foot and her husband Russ is the Bear.
When she cuts loose on her own, she calls her footloose stories and musical
performances "Stories Afoot!" Barb is a former children's librarian, a past
dancer with the traditional clogdance team Dancin' Fools, one-half of Bear Foot,
and one-fifth of the popular old-timey group Rabbit Hash String Band. She
specializes in highly interactive Appalachian storytelling and folklore but
loves to share historical, seasonal, and cultural traditions of other regions as
well. Her captivated audiences range in age from children to senior citizens.
Barb and her husband, veteran performers of over 30 years, make their home in
Batavia, Ohio.
