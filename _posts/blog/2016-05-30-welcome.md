Hello! Welcome to the newly redesigned
[RussChilders.com](http://russchilders.com) site! This site launched more than
15 years ago and has had its content updated numerous times during its life, but 
the style stayed pretty much the same all those years.

Now, we are pleased to bring you a fresh new look that even works on mobile
devices. But don't worry, the site may be new fangled but the music is the same
old timey fare you've come to love.

Have any feedback? Let us know on our

_The original site, because nothing ever really disappears on the internet_
