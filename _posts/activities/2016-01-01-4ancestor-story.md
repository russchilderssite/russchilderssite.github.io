Who are your ancestors? Make a family tree to find out. Ask questions and tape
the answers or write them down. A good way to jog the memories of relatives is
to show them an old quilt and ask for the story of its making. Other things work
well, too: a treasured piece of furniture that's been in the family a long time,
an old dish lovingly stored in the corner cupboard, a faded photograph. Along
the way collect the family stories you hear from your parents, your
grandparents, or favorite uncle or aunt. Polish one up and share it with your
classmates. The class could put their family stories together in a book.
