#### Clothespin dancers or a [limberjack]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/misc/LIMBERJACKS.pdf)

Using patterns provided in Homemade Instruments by Dallas
Cline, collect materials and create dancers for accompanying your homemade
musical instruments (see number 1). Call in grandparents to help with your
building projects. Have them share some of their toy memories and demonstrate
their favorite homemade pastimes, as in the Foxfire Book of Toys and Games.
