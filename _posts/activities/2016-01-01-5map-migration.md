Here is a map that shows the 420 counties officially designated as the
Appalachian Region. On a United States, North American, Western Hemisphere, or
World Map, track your family's migration. Compare with others in the class.
Compile a composite map of migrations. The Appalachian residents migrated from
Europe, British Isles, Africa, Native America.... and are still migrating
today....
