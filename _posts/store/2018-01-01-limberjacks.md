These unique Appalachian lumberjacks are handcrafted to provide many enjoyable hours of fun.  Originally craftsmen  "whittled" these toys into shapes of men which were held together with pieces of wire. I employ power tools and manufactured eye hooks for their assemble.

The basic lumberjacks are men/women, chickens, and goats and come in a verity of colors.
