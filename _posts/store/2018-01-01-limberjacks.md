These unique Appalachian lumberjacks are handcrafted to provide many enjoyable hours of fun.  Originally parents and grandparents "whittled" these toys into shapes of men which were held together with pieces of wire.

The basic lumberjacks are men/women, chickens, and goats and come in a verity of colors.
