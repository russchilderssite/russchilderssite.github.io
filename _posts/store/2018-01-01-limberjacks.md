These unique painted Appalachian limberjacks are handcrafted to provide many enjoyable hours of fun.  Originally craftsmen  whittled these "jacks" into shapes which were held together with pieces of wire. I use power tools and eye hooks for their assembly.

The basic limberjacks are men/women, chickens, and goats and come in a variety of colors.
