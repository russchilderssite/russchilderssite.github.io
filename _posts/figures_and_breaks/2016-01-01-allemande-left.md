ALLEMANDE LEFT, AND AWAY YOU GO 
Originator: Jack Hoheisal, Alhambra, California 

Allemande left and away you go, 

A right and a left and a do-si-do. 

It's corner right, and back to the bar. 

Then into the center like Allemande Thar. 

A left-hand swing, and away you go. 

A right and left and a do-si-do. 

It's corner right, and back to the bar, 

Then into the center like Allemande Thar. 

A left-hand swing, and meet your own. 

Swing her once, and promenade home.
