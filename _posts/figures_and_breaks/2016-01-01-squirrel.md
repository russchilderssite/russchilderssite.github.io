First couple bow, swing, chase that pretty gal around the ring, 

Chase that rabbit, chase that squirrel, chase that pretty gal round the world, 

Chase the possum, chase the coon, chase that big bum round the room. 
Right and left thru across the set, the side four the same, 
Right and left back you're not thru yet, the side four the same, 

Squaws to the center, hands up high, make 'um tepee don't be shy, 

Chiefs duck under on the heel and toe, hurry up injun, don't be slow, 

In and out, out and under, meet 'um squaw, swing like thunder, 

Swing like thunder, 

Alamand left with the old left hand, right to partner right and left grand. 

Meet 'um squaw, purty little taw, promenade to Arkansas. 

(Repeat body of dance for couples two, three, and four). 
Ending with OOOOoooHOW ! ! ! !
