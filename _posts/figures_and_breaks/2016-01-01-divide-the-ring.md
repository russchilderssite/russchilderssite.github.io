DIVIDE THE RING AND DOCEY PARTNERS 

Everybody swing his prettiest gal 
Left allemande and a right hand grand 
And promenade, Oh, Promenade. 

First couple balance, first couple swing 

Down the center and divide the ring 

Lady goes right and the gent goes left 

Docey partners one and all, Docey corners don't you fall 

Swing your own with a pretty little whirl 

And all run away with the corner girl. 

Same old gent and a new little thing 

Down the center and divide the ring 

Lady goes right and the gent goes wrong 

Docey partners one and all, Docey corners don't you fall 

Swing your own with a pretty little whirl 

And all run away with the corner girl. 

(Second couple twice then third couple twice, fourth couple twice.) 

Now your home and everybody swing 
Allemande left with your left hand 
Right hand to partner and a right and left grand 
Promenade eight when you come straight.
