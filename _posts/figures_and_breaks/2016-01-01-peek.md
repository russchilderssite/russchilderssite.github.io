TAKE A LITTLE PEEK 
Music: Turkey in the Straw. 

First couple out to the couple on the right 

Around the couple and take a little peek. 

(Partners divide and peek around the second couple). 

Back to the center and swing your sweet, 

Around that couple and peek once more 

Back to the center and circle four 

And on to couple number three 

And repeat same to couple number four. 

Everybody home and everybody swing. 

(Repeat all with second, third and fourth couples 
leading out.)
