Red River Valley

This singing and swinging square dance evolved from Martha Danforth's singing
call plus the West Virginia version found in a 1947 book called Folk Dances for
All by Michael Herman.

Directions: Square your sets. Directions are to the head (#1 couple) that moves
around the set in counterclockwise fashion to visit #2, #3, and #4. After the
Grand Right and Left, the dance continues with #2 couple visiting #3, #4, and #1.
The dance continues until couples #3 and #4 have led out, ending with the chorus
each time.
  
Red River pal = partner  
  
Girl in the valley = opposite lady  
  
Now you lead right down to the valley   
And you circle to the left and to the right   
Now you swing with the girl in the valley   
And you swing with your Red River pal.  
  
Alternate pattern for second couple met:  
  
Now you lead right down to the valley   
And you circle to the left and to the right   
Now the girls make a wheel in the valley   
And the boys do-si-do so polite.  
  
Now you lead right down to the valley   
And you circle to the left and to the right   
Now you swing with the girl in the valley   
And you swing HOME your Red River pal.  

> **chorus**  
> Now you allemande LEFT on the corner,   
> RIGHT hand to your own, GRAND RIGHT AND LEFT.   
> Now you meet that girl in the valley   
> And you swing HOME your Red River pal.
