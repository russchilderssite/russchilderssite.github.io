# Take a Peek

_Source: Eileen Britton - Jerusalem, Ohio_

Allemande left your corners all, honey   
Allemande left and allemande low, babe   
Meet your honey and what do you do?   
You promenade her two by two   
Honey, baby mine  
  
1st couple out and take a little peek, honey   
Back to the center and swing your sweet, babe   
Around that couple and peek once more   
Back in the center and swing all four   
Honey, baby mine  
  
Same couple out and take a little peek, honey   
Back to the center and swing your sweet, babe   
Around that couple and peek once more   
Back in the center and swing all four   
Honey, baby mine  
  
Same couple out and take a little peek, honey   
Back to the center and swing your sweet, babe   
Around that couple and peek once more   
Back in the center and swing all four   
Honey, baby mine
