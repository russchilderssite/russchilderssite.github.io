I wish I was a mole in the ground (2x)   
If I's a mole in the ground   
I'd root that mountain down   
I wish I was a mole in the ground.  
  
I wish I was a bird in a tree (2x)   
If I's a bird in the tree   
I'd see what I could see   
I wish I was a bird in a tree.  
  
Tempie, let your bangs hang down (2x)   
Let your bangs hang down   
Let them curl all around   
Tempie, let your bangs hang down.  
  
Tempie wants a 2-dollar shawl (2x)   
I come over the hill   
with a 20-dollar bill   
And it's "Honey, where you been so long?"  
  
Honey, where you been so long? (2x)   
I been in the bend   
with the rough and rowdy men,   
And it's Honey, where you been so long?  
  
I don't like a railroad man (2x)   
A railroad man   
will kill you when he can   
And drink up your blood like wine.  
  
I wish I was a hole in the ground (2x)   
If I's a hole in the ground,   
I'd be a mountain upside down,   
I wish I was a hole in the ground.  
  
I wish I was a lizard in the spring (2x)   
If I's a lizard in the spring   
I'd hear my darling sing   
I wish I was a lizard in the spring.
