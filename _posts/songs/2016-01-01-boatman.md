# Boatman Dance

Heigh ho away we go   
Floatin' down the river on the Ohio   
Or,   
Heigh ho the boatman go   
Polin' up the river on the Ohio  
  
Boatman dance, boatman sing   
Boatman do most everything   
When the boatman gets on shore   
He spends his money and he works for more  

> **chorus**  
> Dance boatman dance   
> Sing boatman sing   
> Dance all night til broad daylight   
> Go home with the gals in the morning  

The boatman is a thrifty man   
There's none can do as the boatman can   
He'll steal your sheep, he'll steal your shoat   
He'll put 'em in a bag and take 'em to the boat  
  
> **chorus**  
> Dance boatman dance   
> Sing boatman sing   
> Dance all night til broad daylight   
> Go home with the gals in the morning  
  
_verse_  
I never saw a pretty girl in my life   
But what she wouldn't be a boatman's wife   
When the boatman blows his horn   
Look out old man, your daughter's gone  
  
> **chorus**  
> Dance boatman dance   
> Sing boatman sing   
> Dance all night til broad daylight   
> Go home with the gals in the morning
