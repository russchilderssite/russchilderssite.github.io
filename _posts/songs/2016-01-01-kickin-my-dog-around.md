Me and Willie Dixon and Old Bill Brown   
Tuk a load a' corn to town   
Our ol' dog raised sech a fuss   
We jist had him foller us  
  
As we passed by the gen'ral store   
A crowd of farmers around the door   
Seed our dog 'neath the wagon blocks   
And they pelted him with a bunch of rocks  

> **chorus**  
> Now every time I go to town   
> The boys start kickin my dog around   
> I don't care that he is a hound   
> They gotta stop kickin my dog around  
  
They tied a tin-can to his tail   
And run him past the county jail   
That jist natcherly made me sore   
and Wilie cussed - and Billie swore.  
  
Me and Willie Dixon and old Bill Brown   
Lost no time in a-hoppin down   
We sure cleaned up them boys in town   
Fer kickin my old dog around.  

> **chorus**  
> Now every time I go to town   
> The boys start kickin my dog around   
> I don't care that he is a hound   
> They gotta stop kickin my dog around  
  
Folks say a dog cain't hold no grudge   
But onct when I had too much (budge) (fudge)   
Some fellers tried to do me up   
They didn't count on my old pup.  
  
He seed his duty thar and then   
He lit right into them gentlemen   
He sure messed up that courthouse square   
With rags and meat and hide and hair.  

> **chorus**  
> Now every time I go to town   
> The boys start kickin my dog around   
> I don't care that he is a hound   
> They gotta stop kickin my dog around
