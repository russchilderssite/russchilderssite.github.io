# Soldier, Soldier, Won't You Marry Me?

_(This song comes from the earliest days of our country. Some things never
change.)_

Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me   
with your musket, fife, and drum?   
Oh no, sweet maid, I cannot marry you   
for I have no HAT to put on.  
  
So off she went to the hatmaker's shop   
As fast as she could run,   
She bought him a hat, a very fine hat,   
And the soldier put it on.  
  
Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me   
with your musket, fife, and drum?   
Oh no, sweet maid, I cannot marry you   
for I have no SHIRT to put on, etc.  
  
Britches  
  
Coat  
  
Tie  
  
Boots  
  
Gloves  
  
NOW, soldier, soldier, will you marry me   
with your musket, fife, and drum?   
Oh no, sweet maid, I cannot marry you   
for I have a WIFE at home!!!!
