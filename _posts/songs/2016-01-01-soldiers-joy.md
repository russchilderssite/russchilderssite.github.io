Soldier's Joy

_Soldier's Joy (What is a soldier's joy? It could be his "pay day," another name
for this song from Civil War times.)_

I love somebody, yes I do (3x)   
I love somebody but I won't say who.  
  
Grasshopper sitting on a sweet potato vine (3x)   
Along come a chicken and said "You're mine!"  
  
25 cents for the morphine   
15 cents for the beer   
25 cents for the morphine   
To take me out of here.  
  
I am my father's pride and joy (3x)   
Sing another round of "Soldier's Joy."
