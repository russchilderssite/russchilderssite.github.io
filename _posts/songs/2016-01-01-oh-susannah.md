_(Stephen Foster wrote this nonsense song in Cincinnati, 1840s.)_  
  
I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee   
I'm goin' to Louisiana for my true love for to see   
It rained all night the day I left, the weather it was dry,   
The sun so hot I froze to death,   
Susannah, don't you cry.  
  
> **chorus**  
> Oh Susannah, oh don't you cry for me,   
> I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee.  
  
I jumped aboard the telegraph and traveled down the wires.   
The electric fluid magnified and lit five hundred fires.   
The full moon burst, my horse ran off, I really thought I'd die.   
I shut my eyes to hold my breath,   
Susannah, don't you cry.  
  
I had a dream the other night, when everything was still.   
I dreamt I saw Susannah dear a-comin' down the hill.   
The buckwheat cake was in her mouth, the tear was in her eye.   
Says I "I'm coming from the South,   
Susannah, don't you cry."  
  
I soon will be in New Orleans, and then I'll look around.   
And when I find Susannah dear, I'll fall upon the ground.   
But if I do not find my love, then I will surely die.   
And when I'm gone and six feet down,   
Susannah, don't you cry!
