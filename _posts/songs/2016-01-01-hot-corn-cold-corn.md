Up stairs, downstairs, out in the kitchen   
Up stairs, downstairs, out in the kitchen   
Up stairs, downstairs, out in the kitchen   
See Uncle Bill, he's reeling and pitchin'  
  
Hot corn, cold corn, bring along the demijohn,   
Hot corn, cold corn, bring along the demijohn,   
Hot corn, cold corn, bring along the demijohn,   
Fare you well, Uncle Bill, see you in the morning, Yes sir  
  
Old Aunt Peggy, won't you fill 'em up again,   
Old Aunt Peggy, won't you fill 'em up again,   
Old Aunt Peggy, won't you fill 'em up again,   
Ain't had a drink since I don't know when  
  
All I want to keep me happy   
Two little boys to call me pappy   
One called Paul and one called Davy   
One loves ham and the other loves gravy  
  
Preachers in the pulpit taking in the money   
Childrens in the bee hive taking in the honey   
Old Aunt Sally just a jumpin' for joy   
Happiest lot of people that ever I saw  
  
Yonder comes the preacher and the chickens are a crying   
Yonder comes the preacher and the chickens are a crying   
Yonder comes the preacher and the chickens are a crying   
Toe nails clickin' and feathers are a flyin'
