_This is a 1860s slave spiritual; Pete Seeger used this song during a textile
workers' protest in the 1940s but changed the lyrics in the chorus to "workers
of the south."_

We are climbing Jacob's Ladder   
We are climbing Jacob's Ladder   
We are climbing Jacob's Ladder   
Brothers, sisters, all.  
  
Every round goes higher, higher   
Every round goes higher, higher   
Every round goes higher, higher   
Brothers, sisters, all.  
  
We are climbing higher, higher   
We are climbing higher, higher   
We are climbing higher, higher   
Brothers, sisters, all.
