Dance all night with a bottle in your hand   
a bottle in your hand, a bottle in your hand   
Dance all night with a bottle in your hand,   
Just before dawn, give the fiddler a dram  
  
Who's been here while I've been gone,   
Pretty little girl with the red dress on,   
she took it off, and I put it on,   
In comes Sally with her big boots on  
  
Who's been here since I've been gone   
Old Uncle Ben with his night cap on   
One shoe off and one shoe on,   
In walked Sally with her blue dress on  
  
Dance all night with the fiddlers gal   
Take her round and give her a whirl,   
Up the river and round the bend,   
That's all there is; this is the end
