# What Shall We Do With the Baby-O?

(some verses Gerry Milnes, some Jean Ritchie, some original)

What shall we do with the baby-o  
We'll wrap her up in calico   
We'll send her to her mammy-o   
That's what we'll do with the baby-o (2x)  

What shall we do with the baby-o   
We'll wrap her up in the tablecloth   
We'll throw her up in the stable loft   
That's what we'll do with the baby-o (2x)  

What shall we do with the baby-o   
We'll stick a finger in her eye   
That will surely make her cry   
That's what we'll do with the baby-o (2x)  

What shall we do with the baby-o   
We'll stick our fingers in our ears   
That will make her hard to hear   
That's what we'll do with the baby-o (2x)  

_Arne's verse:_  

What shall we do with the baby-o   
We'll box her up and send her far   
She won't get back by foot or car   
That's what we'll do with the baby-o (2x)  

What shall we do with the baby-o   
We'll tickle her nose and tickle her chin   
We'll wrap her up in the county-pin* (counterpane = bedspread)   
That's what we'll do with the baby-o (2x)  

What shall we do with the baby-o   
We'll dance her north and dance her south   
We'll pour a little moonshine in her mouth   
That's what we'll do with the baby-o (2x)
