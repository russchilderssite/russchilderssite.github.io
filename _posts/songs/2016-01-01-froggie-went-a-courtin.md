Frog went a-courtin' he did ride, uh huh   
Frog went a-courtin' he did ride, uh huh   
Frog went a-courtin' he did ride,   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
Rid his duck to Mousie's den, uh huh   
Rid his duck to Mousie's den, uh huh   
Rid his duck to Mousie's den,   
Asked little Mouse "May I come in?" uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
Asked little Mouse "Will ya marry me?" uh huh   
Asked little Mouse "Will ya marry me?" uh huh   
Asked little Mouse "Will ya marry me?"   
Little Mouse said "Yessiree!" uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
Where will the wedding supper be, uh huh   
Where will the wedding supper be, uh huh   
Where will the wedding supper be,   
'Way down yonder in the holler beech tree, uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
What will the wedding supper be, uh huh   
What will the wedding supper be, uh huh   
What will the wedding supper be,   
Soup and beans and a black-eyed pea, uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
First to come was a big black snake, uh huh   
First to come was a big black snake, uh huh   
First to come was a big black snake,   
Passed around the wedding cake, uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
Next to come was a big old fly, uh huh   
Next to come was a big old fly, uh huh   
Next to come was a big old fly,   
Passed around the wedding pie, uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
Next to come was a little bitty ant, uh huh   
Next to come was a little bitty ant, uh huh   
Next to come was a little bitty ant,   
Tearin' around and trying to dance, uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
Last to come was a little old bug, uh huh   
Last to come was a little old bug, uh huh   
Last to come was a little old bug,   
Passed around the likker jug, uh oh!   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
They all got drunk and had a big fight, uh huh   
They all got drunk and had a big fight, uh huh   
They all got drunk and had a big fight,   
Lord! It was an awful sight, uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  
  
There's a little piece of cornbread sittin on the shelf, uh huh   
There's a little piece of cornbread sittin on the shelf, uh huh   
There's a little piece of cornbread sittin on the shelf,   
If you want anymore, you've got to sing it yourself, uh huh   
Too-dum too-de-oh, too-dum too-de-oh  

_These lyrics come from the singing of Morgan Sexton of eastern Kentucky._
