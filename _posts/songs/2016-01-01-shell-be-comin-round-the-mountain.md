She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes (toot toot)   
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes   
She'll be coming round the mountain   
She'll be coming round the mountain   
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes.  
  
She'll be driving 6 white horses when she comes (whoa back)  

Oh we'll all go out to meet her when she comes (hi babe)
  
Oh we'll kill the old red rooster when she comes (cockadoodledoo)
  
Then we'll all have chicken and dumplings when she comes (yum yum)
  
Oh we'll have to sleep with Granny when she comes (snore, snore)
  
She'll be wearing her red pajamas when she comes (scratch scratch)
  
We'll be sad to see her going when she goes (bye bye)
