_(Elmer Bird WV tune & words*)_  
  
*Old man, old man, can I have your daughter   
To bake my bread and carry my water, Old Man  
  
*Young man, young man, you can't have my daughter   
To be near you and carry your water, Young man  
  
*Ducks on the mill pond, geese in the clover   
Jumped in the bed and the bed turned over, Old Man  
  
_(Gerry Milnes's words)_  
  
Old man, old man, can I have your daughter   
To milk my cow and carry my water? Ha Ha Ha  
  
Yes sir, yes sir, take her on behind you   
Take her up the holler where the devil can't find you, Ha Ha Ha  
  
Old man, old man, give me chew tobaccer   
If y'ain't got homegrown I'll take manufactured, Ha Ha Ha  
  
Ducks on the mill pond, geese in the ocean   
Hug them pretty girls if I take a notion, Ha Ha Ha  
  
Down in the holler I thought I heard a fiddle ring   
Nothing but a little boy pickin on a banjer string, Ha Ha Ha
