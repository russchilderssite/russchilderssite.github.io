Go tell Aunt Rhody, Go tell Aunt Rhody   
Go tell Aunt Rhody, The old gray goose is dead  

The one that she's been saving (3x)   
To make her feather bed  

She died in the mill pond (3x)   
Standing on her head  

The goslings are cryin' (3x)   
Because their mothers dead  

The gander is a mournin'(3x)   
Because his wife is dead  

The barnyard is a weepin'(3x)   
Waiting to be fed

Bye lo, my baby (3x)   
Bye Bye, Bye lo my baby
