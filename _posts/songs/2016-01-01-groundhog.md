Shoulder up your gun and whistle up your dog (2x)   
We're off to the woods to catch a groundhog   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
Here comes Granny walking with a cane (2x)   
Says she's gonna eat groundhog brain   
Eeyew! Ground Hog  
  
Here comes Sal with a great long pole (2x)   
We'll twist that whistle pig outta his hole   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
I dug down but I didn't dig deep (2x)   
I caught that whistle pig fast asleep   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
Put that hog in a big tote sack (2x)   
Slung that sack right over my back   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
Children screamed and children cried (2x)   
They love ground hog stewed or fried   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
Y'eat up the meat and y'save the hide (2x)   
Make the best shoelaces y'ever tied   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
Come here, Pa, make Sally stop (2x)   
She'll eat ground hog til she pops   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
Here comes Sal with a snicker and a grin (2x)   
Groundhog grease all over her chin   
Oh Ground Hog  
  
Little piece of cornbread sittin on the shelf (2x)   
If you want anymore you gotta sing it yourself   
Oh Ground Hog
